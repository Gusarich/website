People tend to multitask more and more as technology and society evolve. And this behavior only becomes stronger as AI integrates into our daily lives. We now consume multiple sources of information and do multiple things at the same time. But for some, that can be very hard — our brains work differently.

The key shift is that now you can actually delegate part of your cognitive load to AI, instantly and effectively, freeing up mental space for more things. If you use AI for two tasks, you can easily handle both at once. Send a message in one window, and while waiting for the result, switch to something else, send a message there too, then switch back and see the first result. Repeat. You’re basically doubling your speed. What were you doing before while waiting for a reply anyway? Scrolling social media? What if you did something else instead?

I've never been good at multitasking. Even with simple things — like talking while doing something physical — I often just stop thinking about one task until I finish the other. I could be putting milk in the fridge while talking to someone and just... stop, fridge wide open, until I finish the sentence, and only then finally put the milk in.

But even with that, I’ve still managed to multitask effectively over the past few weeks thanks to AI. Most of the time when I work now, I handle two things at once — whether it’s job stuff, studies, writing, or some boring online things like booking hotels and planning trips. I often have multiple ChatGPT windows open at the same time, doing different things. And I like it — I like how I can literally get so much more done in the same amount of time.

Of course, not all my work is multitasked. Sometimes I enter long stretches of deep focus on just one task — and even then, AI still helps a lot. It boosts your efficiency even when you’re doing only one thing at a time.

People who are already good at multitasking — and constantly generating ideas in their head — will experience this the most. What if, instead of just writing a fresh idea into your notes, you could instantly open a new tab and start implementing it, without even losing focus on other things? It’s incredible. And it’ll only get better as AI systems evolve. Remember: we’re still early.

Many jobs will eventually transform into manager-like work — but instead of managing people, you'll be managing multiple AI agents at once. Even with today’s AI, you can do so much more, in both quality and quantity. One of the best skills to develop right now is the ability to think and read fast — it directly boosts your efficiency. You don’t need to master specific hard skills. Instead, learn how to learn. Learn how to adapt.
