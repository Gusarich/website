<p>I was playing around with Codex CLI a lot over the holidays, and apart from making it run 30 instances of itself as "subagents" (actually just doing <code>codex exec</code> runs in background terminals) I also decided to buy a fresh Mac Mini and give it to Codex.</p>
<p><img src="content/photo.png" alt="Mac Mini" style="width: 50%;"></p>
<p>I quickly implemented a pretty simple setup, that consists of a <strong>Codex caller</strong> that controls Codex process and that forces it to run in an endless loop, and a <strong>Telegram bot</strong> through which I interact with the agent.</p>
<p>The setup was the easiest part to implement and I actually spent about 20x more time on writing first working versions of prompts with Claude. Prompts are everything here.</p>
<p>I decided to use Codex here with GPT-5.2 model on Extra High reasoning effort, as that is the best model available in terms of instruction following and long context. Earlier I saw it run for 3 hours doing 4 compactions in the process and still delivering a good result for a non-trivial problem.</p>
<p>The instruction following is essential in this experiment as the agent must reliably interact with me and follow all the guidance I gave it about using the computer, interacting with me and keeping notes.</p>
<p>Long-context accuracy is the second most important part, as this agent will run endlessly for days, weeks, or maybe months. Working on a specific problem for a few hours is much simpler than delivering consistently good (and even improving) results for a week straight without resets.</p>
<p>I won't explain too much about the setup, but the core here was giving agent a lot of context about [who, where, when, and how] it is, and instructing it to take notes. A lot of notes. All the time.</p>
<p>I'll be using this agent as an assistant for some time. It's nice to be able to message it from my phone and ask it to push some change in a repository. Or ask it to research something overnight using ChatGPT in a browser.</p>
<p>I'll probably stop the experiment if I don't find it useful over multiple days in a row. In this case I'll just wait for the next version of GPT and try again.</p>
<p>Whether it turns out to work great or not, I'll post an update later.</p>
