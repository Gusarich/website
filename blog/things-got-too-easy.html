<p>AI provides incredible value to me and to many other people in our daily lives and work. It's now possible to do more, better, and faster than ever. But I realized that the progression of AI capabilities outpaced the progression of my goals.</p>
<p>I recently started thinking in retrospect about what I was doing and what I was thinking about in the past months, and it feels like I didn't really face any <em>hard</em> challenges in many months.</p>
<p>I can't remember the last time I was thinking about a problem for a week straight myself because it was so nontrivial. In most cases AI just one-shots stuff or does so after a couple of days of low-effort prompting iterations.</p>
<p>I was thinking a lot about different stuff, but it was more of a meta-analysis or idea generation of some kind. I didn't really struggle with the execution part for a long time.</p>
<p>Very often when I see something I'd like to try doing, it just works with AI very quickly. I just get quick dopamine from low-effort achievements. And it allowed me to minimize my effort in many ways while keeping the product of my work at a level not much higher than before. That's not what my goals should be.</p>
<p>I believe that I should aim much higher than I was trying to aim before. Higher than I could have ever imagined a couple of years ago. If AI makes it so easy to do things that took weeks before, I should do things that would take years before. I think now is the time when this becomes possible to execute.</p>
<p>I should try to keep the bar of my goals at the level where my own mental effort stays high enough, so that I'm not underaiming. I should stay at the limit of both my and AI's capabilities. It will probably maximize the product of my work.</p>
<p>And the first step is to discover where that limit actually is. I want to find out how far I can push before I start struggling. I think that incredible things can be done in a month of real mental effort of a single human supercharged with many AI agents.</p>
<p>I have a few ideas for what to try. Things that I didn't really think of until recently, because it was absurd for me to even consider trying them.</p>
