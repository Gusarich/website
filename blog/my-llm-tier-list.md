When I wrote [What LLM to use today?](https://gusarich.com/blog/what-llm-to-use-today), I realized that this would become obsolete very soon once new models are released. So I decided to make a live tier list of frontier LLMs and keep it updated with my opinions on the latest models that I've used myself.

It is accessible at [LLM tier list](https://gusarich.com/llm-tierlist), and I'll make sure to update it every time I have tested a new frontier model well enough to have a proper opinion on it.

It's important to note that these ranks are very subjective, and it all depends on the use cases. But if your needs from AI match mine at least in some ways, I recommend checking it out sometimes.

At the moment I mostly care about agentic usage with extensive reasoning and great instruction following, and GPT-5.2 leads here, while Gemini 3 Pro is an outsider.
